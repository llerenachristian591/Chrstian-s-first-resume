        Hi, my name is Christian Llerena, I'm 24 years old and I'm from Ecudor. I'm a Data Science student at the Phillips University in Marburg Germany
        and I am currently taking a web develoaper course, to improve my skills at coding a little bit. This is my resume :D<br />
        I'm cosindered a very nice person and I really like helping others :D.
        In my free time I like to play basketball or chess, and I also like to have a drink with friends and talk about life.<br />
        In my childhood my dream was to become a doctor, but after giving it a try, it turned out I dind't really like it. So now I'm studying Data Sience and I'm currently
        on my 5th semester.<br />
        I really hope you guys like my webpage :D
